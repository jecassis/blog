My GPS watch is a Garmin Forerunner 935 in case you were wondering.

But what is on my GPS watch when I race and how do I use it?

Let me explain each screen and the fields for my "Run Race"; profile.

## The Screens

### Main Screen

This screen is usually the only one I use during the race, but we have more just in case.

1. Time: Total elapsed time because this is the variable we want to minimize :)
2. Lap Pace: By pressing the lap button manually at every km or mile marker, this field shows the cumulative pace from that point. The idea is for this number to converge to the desired pace.
3. Distance: Total distance covered because a marathon is a fixed distance. I always assume this number is about 5% in error.
4. Heart Rate: Essentially this tends to correlate to the effort at a given pace. Often times there is a target for this.

### Lap Screen

This screen shows the current lap information. The way to think about this screen is a timer that is zeroed 42 or 26 times in a marathon which breaks the race down into manageable chunks.

1. Lap Time: Total elapsed time since the last km or mile marker when I pressed the lap button.
2. Lap Pace: Same as main screen.
3. Lap Distance: Total distance covered because a marathon is a fixed distance. I always assume this number is about 5% in error.
4. Heart Rate: Same as main screen.

### Summary Screen

This screen shows the summary information for the race in case I want to see how I've been doing up to that point.

1. Average Pace: Self-explanatory.
2. Last Lap Time: Keeps the last split in case I missed it when I pressed the lap button.
3. Average Cadence: Again self-explanatory.
4. Average Heart Rate: Also self-explanatory.

### Miscellaneous Screen

This screen shows some miscellaneous information for the race in case I want to see how I've been doing up to that point.</P>

1. Heading: It might be interesting but usually not.
2. Temperature: If I ever look at this I become depressed because I'm probably not feeling great.
3. Power: I don't find it very reliable as in the bike, but I have a field for it so that it is recorded.
4. Elevation: Also might be interesting but not terriblyuseful.
