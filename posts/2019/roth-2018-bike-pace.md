For Challenge Roth 2018, I estimated my FTP to be 228. It took me 6:21:40 to complete the 180km using a NP of 140<a id="s1" class="ref" href="#f1">[1]</a>. The IF thus was 0.614 and the TSS was around 240.

Looking at the chart below<a id="s2" class="ref" href="#f2">[2]</a> for a 6:20:00ish time it has become clear that I left way too much time on the table. A conservative ride should have been closer to 5% NP higher.

This would have netted a time of around 6:06:00 (according to Best Bike Split) at the TSS cost of 275 which would have put me in the good range to still have a good run time.

We'll just have to manage the effort better next time and not hold back as much on the bike.
